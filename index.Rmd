## More semantic learning real applied skills


1.  In all these courses, the students will learn how to solve problems with **real** data, using statistical thinking and computational skills.


1.  They also develop essential soft skills of curiosity, collaboration and communication.



> We want our students to learn the concepts of statistics (semantics) and not be drowned with more formulas (syntax). 


.footnote[Associate Professor David Easdown has a great [paper](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/pubs/publist/preprints/2009/easdown-12.pdf) on syntactic and semantic reasoning in mathematical learning. It took me a great deal of time to appreciate the embodied ideas.]

### These courses will be different to your 1st year statistics class

---


## Kevin: why are these courses seem 'softer'?

Example 1: what is the definition of sample correlation coefficient between two observed variables $x$ and $y$?

--

+ When I did 1st year statistics: 

$$r_{xy} =  \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}} = \frac{n \sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i }{\sqrt{n \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2} \sqrt{n \sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2}}.$$

--

+ Linear algebra: it is the inner product between the centered vectors $x$ and $y$, divided by the products of their $L_2$ norms.

--

+ Geometry: it is the cosine of the angle between the centered vectors $x$ and $y$ in the $\mathbb{R}^n$ space.

> Correlation is a **measure of similarity** between $x$ and $y$ to inform us something about the data. But the intuitive interpretation takes a bit more mathematical training. 

---

## More intuitions and more inter-linked contents

+ How *tightly clustered* are $x$ and $y$ around the trend line? How to measure similarity $x$ and $y$ *using a number*? 

<center>
<img src="figures/two_scatter_plots.png", width="40%">
</center>

<!-- + We look at the *centre and spread* of each paired observation in $x$ and $y$ using z-scores. Then, we get a *joint summary* of the two z-scores using multiplication and averaging.  -->

+ Mean<sup>*</sup> of the product of the z-scores of $x$ and $y$

$$r_{xy}={\frac {1}{n-1}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left({\frac {x_{i}-{\bar {x}}}{s_{x}}}\right)\left({\frac {y_{i}-{\bar {y}}}{s_{y}}}\right).$$ 

+ Every single word in this definition were introduced previously in the course, and some concepts were recycled for emphasis. 

---

## Format of tutorials 

+ .blue[Old tutorials:] Kevin walks into the room, explains the key calculation for the first 5-10 minutes. Students do some questions on pen and paper to make sure they will know how to do this in the assignment and the final exam. 

+ .red[New tutorials:] Students actually get a quiz for the first 10 minutes. The motivations in the tutorial are the data and the thinking questions in textbook. Students then complete the rest of the worksheet using R Markdown.

---

## Tutorial preparation 

> In some ways, we are asking more out of our students. We need them to do the statistical thinking as well as the computations.  

+ Please read the teaching guide and the tutorial worksheet & the data before the class. Solutions/code to the questions are available. Try to **discuss** the answers with the students, don't force feed them. 

--

+ Whenever an unexpected question arises, you can't get out of it by declaring maths formulas.

### What was the hardest thing about using `R` in your undergraduate studies?

---

## Some selected questions throughout the semester

1. Where are my **files and folders**?
1. How do I read in this **Excel sheet**? How can I **clean** my data?
1. How do I do this **graph**? How do I calculate this **number**?

> But they rarely ask the question "What is the **purpose** of this graph/number?". 

--

By the end of this course, students should:

+ Use RStudio and RMarkdown.
+ Read in an Excel spreadsheet.
+ Produce basic numerical and graphical summaries.
+ Write up a basic exploratory analysis report that .brand-blue[addresses a research question].

# Demo for setting up the file system

## Some tips for RStudio + RMarkdown (Week 1 to 4)

+ http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/JM/DATA1001/r/current/guides/RGuide.html

> That inability to recognise where the Excel files are located in which folder will be the biggest obstacle for our student in the first 2 weeks. 

+ We are aiming for one single R-Project for the entire course. 

+ They should use a `.Rmd` file (not R script) for every tutorial. These questions ger progressively harder.

+ The biggest source of confusion is the **chunks**. Reinforce this idea that anything in a chunk is R code, everything else is your personal comments on the R outputs. 

+ Sloooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwww down for your students.

# Demo for reading and cleaning data

---

## Some tips for coding (1)

+ `janitor::clean_names()` is perhaps the simplest function to reduce student frustrations when completing projects.


.scroll-box-20[
```{r}
dirtyIris = readr::read_csv("data/dirtyIris.csv")
colnames(dirtyIris)
janitor::clean_names(dirtyIris)
```
]


---

## Some tips for coding (2)

+ Students are gentle creatures, they do not like the sight of error/warnings messages in sharp red text.


```{r,error=TRUE}
ggplot(iris) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```



<center>
<img src="figures/deer.jpg", width="40%">
</center>


---

## Don't try to be (too) perfect

+ Showing your programming mistakes and then correcting them send a positive signal to your students. 

+ Garth was particularly good at this. He would do live Google searches even though he probably knows the answer. 

--


```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```

---
## Some tips for coding (3)

Use `tidyverse` sparingly:

<img src="figures/base_tidyverse.jpg", width="80%">
</center>



---

## A pedantic example

+ Student: How can I do a **dot plot** or the **line plot** for the median of the `iris` data across the `species` categories? 

1.  First, could you show me the data please?
1.  .red[Why] do you want to see the median?

--

<br>

+ Student: So I can say that there is an *increasing trend* across the three categories for my report.

1.  Why not just do a boxplot across the three categories?
1.  Could you draw for me, .red[by hand], what you think this boxplot would look like?

---

## True or false? 

+ In the `iris` dataset, the variable `Sepal.Length` is negatively correlated with `Sepal.Width`, it is therefore necessary that these two variablse must also be negatively correlated in any arbitarily chosen `Species`. 


```{r}
table(iris$Species)
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

---

## Try to lead your students to a more comprehensive answer

```{r, fig.width=11}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species)
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width ~ iris$Species)
```

---
## Summary 
.large[

+ There is a stronger emphasis on statistical thinking and computation.

+ You don't have to impress your students by showing you know more maths symbols. 

+ Impress them by showing more insights of the concept. 

+ The courses are different, so do necessary preparations before tutorial.

+ Be prepared for non-standard questions in their projects.

+ Approach your lecturers and other senior tutors for advice, we are all in this together.
