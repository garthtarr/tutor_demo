## More semantic learning & real applied skills


1.  Students will learn how to solve problems with **real** data, with strong emphasis on statistical thinking and computational skills.
1.  They will also develop essential soft skills of collaboration and communication.


> We want our students to learn the concepts of statistics (semantics) and the practice of data science. We do not want them to be drowned by formulas (syntax) they don't understand. 


.footnote[Associate Professor David Easdown has a great [paper](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/pubs/publist/preprints/2009/easdown-12.pdf) on syntactic and semantic reasoning in mathematical learning. It took me a great deal of time to appreciate the ideas.]

### These courses will be different to your 1st year statistics class

---


## Kevin: why do these courses seem 'softer'?

Example 1: what is the definition of sample correlation coefficient between $x$ and $y$?

Submit your answer at https://forms.gle/H9Ur2qfoF248Vi2d6.

--

+ When I did 1st year statistics: 

$$r_{xy} =  \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}} = \frac{n \sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i }{\sqrt{n \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2} \sqrt{n \sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2}}.$$

--

+ Linear algebra: it is the .brand-blue[inner product] between the .brand-blue[centered vectors] $x$ and $y$, divided by the products of their $L_2$ .brand-blue[norms].

--

+ Geometry: it is the .brand-blue[cosine of the angle] between the .brand-blue[centered vectors] $x$ and $y$.

> Correlation is a **measure of similarity** between $x$ and $y$ which informs us something about the data. But the intuitive geometric interpretation takes a bit more mathematical training. 

---

## More intuitions and more inter-linked contents

+ Visual: How **tightly clustered** are $x$ and $y$ around the trend line? 
+ Numerical: How to measure similarity $x$ and $y$ **using a number**? 

<center>
<img src="figures/two_scatter_plots.png", width="40%">
</center>

<!-- + We look at the *centre and spread* of each paired observation in $x$ and $y$ using z-scores. Then, we get a *joint summary* of the two z-scores using multiplication and averaging.  -->

+ .brand-red[Populations] correlation is the mean of the product of the .brand-blue[z-scores] of $x$ and $y$.

--

$$r_{xy}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac {x_{i} - {\bar {x}}}{s_{x}}\right) \left(\frac {y_{i} - {\bar {y}}}{s_{y}}\right).$$ 

+ .brand-blue[z-score] was already introduced in the course. The difference between .brand-red[population] and .brand-red[sample] is emphasised again. 

---

## Format of DATA1001 tutorials 

+ .brand-blue[Old tutorials:] Kevin walks into the room, explains the key calculation for the first 5-10 minutes. Students do some questions on pen and paper to make sure they will know how to do this in the assignment and the final exam. 

--

+ .brand-red[New tutorials:] Students actually get a quiz for the first 10 minutes. The tutorial motivations are the data and the thinking questions in textbook. Students then complete the rest of the worksheet using R Markdown.

</center>



---

## Tutorial preparation 

> You can't solve all questions by declaring maths formulas. 

+ Please read the [R Guide](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/JM/DATA1001/r/current/guides/RGuide.html) and the tutorial worksheet & the data before the class.
+ **Discuss** the solutions (not the numerical answer) with the students, so they can see how you make **statistical arguments**.

### What was the hardest thing about using `R` in your undergraduate studies?

---

## By the end of this course, students should:

+ Use RStudio and RMarkdown.
+ Read in an Excel spreadsheet.
+ Produce basic numerical and graphical summaries.
+ Write up a basic exploratory analysis report that .brand-blue[addresses a research question]. 

--

.brand-red[.font170[Common questions]]

1. Where are my **files and folders**?
1. How do I read in this **Excel sheet**? How can I **clean** my data?
1. How do I do this **graph**? How do I calculate this **number**?

> But they rarely ask the question "What is the **purpose** of this graph/number?".

# Demo 1: setting up a folder system: download files into a folder with subfolders, `setwd()`. 


<center>
<img src="figures/folderStr.jpeg", width="70%">
</center>

---

## What I suppose to teach you

+ [R Guide](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/JM/DATA1001/r/current/guides/RGuide.html), section 1.5 to 1.8. We are aiming for **one single folder** for the entire course. 

+ Every week, students will download a `.Rmd` file and data files into the folder, and work on those questions. 

+ Everyone should have the same folder structure.

+ My experience tells me that no one ever does this. 

  - They will create new folders every week
  - Create subfolders within the main folder
  - Mis-spell folder names
  - Windows uses backward-slashes which doesn't help either. 

---

## An alternative using RStudio Project

> The working directory of a `.Rmd` file is not the same as the working directory of the RStudio.

> That inability to recognise where the Rmd/Excel files are located in which folder will be the biggest obstacle for our student in the first 4 weeks. 


My solution to this is to go to RStudio - New Project: 

+ Click `New Directory` if they haven't set up a folder yet. 
+ Click `Existing Directory` if they already set up a folder. 


(I am not suppose to teach you this as it is not on the R Guide, but if they follow this procedure correctly, they should never ask this question ever again.)

---


## Some tips for RStudio + RMarkdown

+ The biggest source of confusion is the **chunks**. Reinforce this idea that anything in a chunk is R code, everything else are comments on the R outputs. 

+ Sloooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwww down for your students.

+ Use the `tab` key!! 

+ The R Guide is the basic assessable material, there is no need to do complex coding in class.

+ But in projects, students are encouraged to explore new coding options, e.g. `tidyverse`.

# Demo 2: reading and cleaning data

---

## Two simple functions 

+ `readr::read_csv()` has some advantages over `utils::read.csv()`, especially with factors. I strongly recommend against RStudio's point-and-click option. 

+ `janitor::clean_names()` is perhaps the simplest function to reduce student frustrations when completing projects.

.scroll-box-20[
```{r}
dirtyIris = readr::read_csv("data/dirtyIris.csv")
colnames(dirtyIris)
janitor::clean_names(dirtyIris)
```
]


---

## Tips on reading and cleaning data


+ Don't try to be (too) perfect. Students are gentle creatures, they do not like the sight of error/warnings messages in sharp red text.

```{r,error=TRUE}
ggplot(iris) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```

<center>
<img src="figures/deer.jpg", width="40%">
</center>

---

## Tips on reading and cleaning data

+ Showing your programming mistakes and then correcting them can send a positive signal to your students. 

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```

## Students struggle with subsetting data (1)

`R` is partially blamed for this. This [base R cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf) helps.

```{r}
x = 1:5; names(x) = letters[1:5]
x[c(2)] ## Index subsetting
x[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)] ## Logical subsetting

x[-c(1, 3, 4, 5)] ## Eliminiation using negative indexing
head(iris$Species) ## Unique only to data.frame column subsetting
```

+ Logical vector must be the same length as the `vector`, or number of rows/columns as the `data.frame`.
+ `$` doesn't work if the column name contain spaces*, for example `data$Sepal Length`. 
+ It is hard, and I haven't worked out the best way to teach this. Sarah suggested [this](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html).

# Demo: two real examples from my tutorial

---

## Example 1


```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
theme_set(
  theme_bw(20)
)
```

Student asks: how can I do a **dot plot** or the **line plot** for the median of this data for the `species` categories? 

--

1. The question is not well-formulated. Be patient with them. 

2. Students always asks "how". Don't be trapped by that question. Ask them why they want to do such a plot?

--

> First, could you show me the data please?

The `iris` dataset. 

-- 

> .brand-red[Why] do you want to see the median?

--

So I can say that there is an *increasing trend* across the three categories for my report.

---

> This data has four continuous variables. When you say increasing trend, which one of the four are you referring to?

Say, the `Sepal.Length`?

--
 
> So given one coninuous variable (`Sepal.Length`), and a discrete variable (`Species`), how would you draw a line plot or dot plot?

I can't do a line plot. But maybe a dot plot like this? 

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=16, echo = FALSE}
plot(as.integer(iris$Species), iris$Sepal.Length)
```
---
> Can you tell the trends is actually increasing from this "dot plot"? Especially considering there are ranges of points that overlaps?

No, I probably can't. 

> If you check you lecture notes, can you find out what is the recommended visualisation for cases where we have one coninuous variable and a discrete variable? And what the function?

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species)
```

--- 

## Example 1 extended

Most students will have trouble subsetting/summarising data. I strongly recommend the `dplyr` package for this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html. 


```{r}
# library(dplyr)
iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarise_all(median)
```

---

## Example 2: Simpson's paradox

True or false? 

> In the `iris` dataset, we know the variable `Sepal.Length` is negatively correlated with `Sepal.Width`. Therefore, it is necessary that these two variables must also be negatively correlated in any arbitrarily chosen `Species`. 

```{r}
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

Yes, because the overall trend is an aggregation of the individual trends. And therefore each trends themselves must be negative. 

---

## Example 2: calculating the correlation

> Why don't you try to find out by actually calculating the correlation values?


```{r}
cor(iris[iris$Species == "setosa",]$Sepal.Length, iris[iris$Species == "setosa",]$Sepal.Width)
cor(iris[iris$Species == "versicolor",]$Sepal.Length, iris[iris$Species == "versicolor",]$Sepal.Width)
cor(iris[iris$Species == "virginica",]$Sepal.Length, iris[iris$Species == "virginica",]$Sepal.Width)
```

---

## Example 2: calculating the correlation

> Good! Let me teach you a much easier way

```{r}
iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarise(cor = cor(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
```

---


## Example 2: plotting

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=16}
ggplot(iris,
       aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_grid(~Species, margins = TRUE)
```

---
## Summary on the course itself
.large[

+ There is a stronger emphasis on statistical thinking and computation.

+ You don't have to impress your students by showing you know more maths symbols. Impress them by showing more insights of the concept. 

+ Ask leading questions. Don't give out free answers. 

+ The courses are different, so do the necessary preparations before tutorial. The [R Guide](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/JM/DATA1001/r/current/guides/RGuide.html) is your friend. 
]

---

## Summary on the coding component
.large[
+ There is an infinite number of functions/packages that I can go through with you, but given the time we have I can only recommend that you start with `readr::read_csv`, `janitor::clean_names`, `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. 

+ Use the R [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

+ Be prepared for non-standard questions in their projects.

+ Approach your lecturers and other senior tutors for advice, we are all in this together.
